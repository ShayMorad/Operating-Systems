# 📘 Operating Systems

</div>



This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments from the **Operating Systems** course at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://new.huji.ac.il/).

Throughout the course, we explored low-level systems programming, focusing on memory management, user-level threads, concurrency, virtual memory, and kernel concepts. Each exercise tackled a different aspect of modern operating systems through hands-on C++/C programming.
